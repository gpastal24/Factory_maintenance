# Factory Maintenance 
##
This is a very basic implementation of a kivy app that is able to read machines and parts from a database, update the database by adding additional machines, parts and information regarding the last maintenance of the selected part. 

The code is clumsy and some buttons  are in greek but it is functional. 

I haven't implemented the last maintenance updater for now though , and I am mainly looking into making a kivyMD app for this project so I don't think this functionality will be introduced in this repo.

App has been tested on android and linux .


I have used some things from this repository https://github.com/techwithtim/Kivy-GUI-Example .

## Requirements 
  * Python 
  * kivy
  * buildozer (for android)
  * PyInstaller (for PC)
